# Cricket score checker
Pretty useless, purely hobby project that finds England cricket scores.
Firstly finds the most recent game & checks if it's live. Then finds the overs gone & prints this with the lists of scores. Updates this every ball but will loop infinitely

## Checking other team scores
Can manually edit the 'teamUrl' to look at other teams scores. Replace 'england-1' with, say, 'england-women-975' or 'yorkshire-1464'
